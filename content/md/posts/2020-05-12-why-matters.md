When I've asked colleagues about their 'personal process', I'm surprised how many give me a blank stare
and say 'I don't really have one.' This isn't all that surprising. Programmers are often known for not
liking process, especially anything imposed on them by management.

organization and outside it.

So the next few entries will include some ideas I've heard or tried for how to do just that.
