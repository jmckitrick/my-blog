I've been kicking around the idea of starting a blog for some time now.
I'm hoping to share some random ramblings here, partly to share my
observations and partly just to record them.

## Topics

I certainly plan to write about programming. But I'd like to talk about often overlooked
issues for programmers. Things I've found noteworthy enough to share with you.

* languages
* tools
* productivity
* tips
* observations

## Ideas for next post

We all likely have the 'essential' tools required for our job:

* email
* feature/ticket system
* VCS
* chat

But there are a lot of gaps. What about your *personal* process?
How do you capture additional knowledge for future work on your project?
How do you track status in a more granular way, particularly if it is not
imposed by your organization? Do you even *need* any more structure?
